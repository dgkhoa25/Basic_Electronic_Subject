This project is created based on a subject with topic "Basic Electronic Project" (Đồ án Điện tử căn bản).

The name of project is "Designing model weighs mass to serve for mixing cement". 

******************************** ABSTRACT ***********************************************************

In order to help minimize errors in the process of providing materials for the consolidation process, this topic will provide a solution with a model of considering the forces serving that work.
The goal of this project is to help people limit errors, shortages, or excesses of materials by using mass sensors and digital signal processing systems to give the most accurate amount of materials 
needed to supply to the mixing systems. Some of the benefits of the project are: contributing to improving the accuracy of the quantity to be used and converting between different types of cement to be 
scanned automatically, saving users time, calculate, estimate. With this model, the system will process sequentially, so an error during the run is possible if a part of the input signal goes wrong.
Compared with the manual mixing method, this system will be more efficient in speed, with an accurate output volume of about 90%.
